# Searchvis 
Searchvis is a visualization application for various pathfinding algorithms.
Squares have colors that represent different features in the application.
The main features include a start(GREEN) and goal(RED) square that are able to be moved to any location on the grid.
The user is also able to create barriers(GREY) for the search to maneuver around as well as the choice between 4 different algorithms.

## Square Colors
1. GREEN = start
2. RED = goal
3. GREY = wall
4. WHITE = unexpanded
5. OTHER = expanded

## Algorithms
1. Depth-First Search
2. Breadth-First Search
3. Uniform Cost Search
4. A* Search
