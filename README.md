# Searchvis 
Searchvis is a visualization application for various pathfinding algorithms.
Squares have colors that represent different features in the application.
The main features include a start and end square that are able to be relocated to any location on the grid by click-and-drag.
The user is also able to create barriers for the search to maneuver around by either clicking at a singular location, or clicking and dragging the cursor around to make multiple barriers. The user has the choice between 4 different search algorithms, represented as buttons.
Different keybinds are available for various functions to be initiated.
